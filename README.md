# Shortest Path Finder using Dijkstra’s Algorithm

Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GSAP (for animations)

Developed an interactive graph visualization tool that allows users to create nodes and dynamically add edges to simulate real-world pathfinding.
Implemented Dijkstra’s Algorithm to compute the shortest path between nodes in a visually engaging manner.
Designed a drag-and-drop UI where users can place nodes dynamically and adjust edge weights manually.
Integrated real-time animations using GSAP to enhance user experience by smoothly rendering nodes, edges, and shortest path visualization.
Optimized the algorithm for efficient path calculations in graphs with up to 12 nodes.
Ensured high usability by implementing interactive tooltips, instruction guides, and validation checks to prevent errors.
